      - **compute** - (*1-28 cores*) Use any available Mio compute node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **gpu** - (*1-32 cores*) Use an Mio GPU node that has an NVIDIA Tesla P100
        GPU with an X server running in the background. This utilizes the GPU for hardware
        accelerated 3D visualization. There are 5 of these nodes on Wendian.
