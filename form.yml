      - **compute** - (*1-36 cores*) Use any available Wendian compute node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **gpu** - (*1-24 cores*) Use an Wendian GPU node that has an NVIDIA Tesla V100
        GPU with an X server running in the background. This utilizes the GPU for hardware
        accelerated 3D visualization. There are 5 of these nodes on Wendian.
